<h1>Web Server - Nginx</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this assignment, we will set up a web server using Docker Desktop. Below are the step-by-step instructions for pulling and running the image to create a container in detached mode, running in the background, and exposing the port with port binding. Additionally, we will name the container to match the image that we are pulling and running.
